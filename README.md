## Features 🐕  

### **Robotics**
- **Real-time Command Execution**: Kevin analyzes Twitch chat every 30 seconds and performs the most popular user-submitted command (e.g., `/sit`, `/wave`, `/360`).
- **Precision Movements**: Powered by 15 magnetically encoded servos, enabling smooth, lifelike motions with omnidirectional mobility and six-dimensional attitude control.
- **Advanced AI**: Includes features like face detection, voice recognition, and object tracking for a smarter interactive experience.

### **Social Media Integration**
- **Autonomous X/Twitter Agent**: Kevin uses Eliza, an AI agent by a16z, to post autonomous updates, interact with followers, and share his adventures in real time.
- **Dynamic Content**: Posts are AI-generated, sharing Kevin's latest tricks, thoughts, and humorous takes on his day-to-day robotic life.

### **Tech Specs**
- Built on the XGO-mini2 robotic platform, featuring:
  - Raspberry Pi CM4 for AI edge computing.
  - ESP32-WROVER for core control and communication.
  - 4GB memory and multiple interfaces for extensibility.
- Programmable via Python, ROS, or graphical programming tools.
